Scaling MySQL
	- Performance
	- Capacity: how to handle load
		○ Quantity of data
		○ Number of users
		○ User activity
		○ Size of related datasets
	- Scalability
		○ Scaling up:
		buying more powerful hardware
		○ Scaling out
		○ Scaling by consolidation
		○ Scaling by clustering
		○ Scaling back

	- Scaling out
		○ Functional partitioning
		○ Data sharding
		○ Choosing a partitioning key
		○ Multiple partitioning keys
		○ Querying across shards
		○ Allocating data, shards, and nodes
		○ Arranging shards on nodes
		○ Fixed allocation
		○ Dynamic allocation
		○ Mixing dynamic and fixed allocation
		○ Explicit allocation
		○ Rebalancing shards
		○ Generating globally unique Ids
		○ Tools for sharding
			○ Connecting to the correct shard and querying it
			○ Distributed consistency checks
			○ Aggregating results across shards
			○ Cross-shard joins
			○ Locking and transaction management
			○ Creating shards (or at least discovering new shards on the fly) and rebalancing shards if you have time to implement this

Load balancing
Scalability
	Load balancing can help with certain kinds of scalability strategies, such as read-write splitting to read from replicas.
Efficiency
	Load balancing helps you use resources more efficiently because you have control over how requests are routed. This is particularly important if your servers aren’t all equally powerful: you can direct more work to the more powerful machines.
Availability
	A smart load-balancing solution uses the servers that are available at each moment.
Transparency
	Clients don’t need to know about the load-balancing setup. They don’t have to care about how many machines are behind the load balancer, or what their names are; the load balancer lets the clients see a single virtual server.
Consistency
	If your application is stateful (database transactions, website sessions, etc.), the load balancer should direct related requests to a single server so that the state isn’t lost between requests. This relieves the application of having to keep track of which server it’s connected to.
